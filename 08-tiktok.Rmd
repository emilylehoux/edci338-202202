## Demographics {-} 

### Target Audience and Users {-}

 Tik Tok is available in over 150 countries, storing the information of over 1 billion users. The widespread population of users has approximately 120 million users residing in the United States, 87 million from Indonesia and 72 million in Brazil. Surprisingly, Canada does not currently make the shortlist of countries (top 10), that hold the greatest number of users. Owed to the increase of technological advancement, it is evident why the main demographic of consumers is what is commonly referred to as the “Gen Z”. A totalled 60% of users match Gen Z’s age group (individuals born between the years of 1997-2012) with a majority aged between 10-25. With that being said, it should be noted that TikTok requires its users to meet the minimum age requirement of 13 years old. 
 An older demographic of seniors can be seen on this app too, though they constitute an unusual subset. Similar success has been recorded of older generations, with great traction and activity on their platforms. To name a few, @oldgays is a group of older men that share their thoughts and opinions on life, and @cookingwithLynja shares insight on how to make yummy meals in a quick and easy fashion. 
 In comparing the gender of TikTok’s users, there is an obvious breakdown of genders and their active use on the app. To date, identified females make up the majority of users with a remainder of male users (39%) and others (2%) constituting the rest. TikTok targets individuals with interests and hobbies of all sorts. Promising a guarantee for users to be matched with creators that align with their hobbies and interests, running from fashion to baking, dance and/ or travel. 
 Tiktok has enabled users to create business accounts to allow for easy, accessible and reviewal of the accounts analytics. Businesses in particular have greatly utilized the analytics page to pinpoint the age, gender, and likes of their active users. The information received from the analytics, successfully supplies and equips companies with the proper tools to adapt and  progress. 

#### Non-users {-}

TikTok does not require users to create an account to browse the platform. There are a variety of methods that allow non-users to navigte the platform. With a few simple steps, users that do not wish make an account are able to view the content. 
The first option consists of following three simple steps:
1. Go to TikTok.com
2. Select “For you” on the left sidebar 
3. Begin watching videos without logging into an account

Videos made and created on TikTok’s platform can also be viewed on other neighbouring media platforms. Multiple channels on youtube have dedicated their content to uploading what is currently trending on Tik Tok. Content creators of youtube make it possible for users without an account to gain quick and easy access to like and comment on the video on youtube. 
TikTok videos may also be viewed without an account if they’re sent by message, Snapchat, email, Facebook etc. 
With that being said, there are a variety of features that can not be accessed by users without an account. Without an account, you are unable to follow creators, like videos, see or write comments on the videos, upload or share content or join creators ‘lives’.

#### How Users are Connected {-}

TikTok features allow users to generate communities online. Users can stay connected through the act of sharing, following, commenting or liking other creators’ posts. Simply by locating and following a creator’s account, their videos will be readily available for viewing in the “following” section of TikTok. Unless the creator’s content is made private, a user does not need to wait for access to be granted, in order to proceed in viewing the video of the account. Furthermore, there are obligations for users to follow one another back, however, access to the creator’s videos is still made available regardless of mutual following. 
 There exists two types of pages to view content. The ‘for you page’ showcases viral Tik Toks and creators of all sorts. This side of TikTok may allow users to discover new creators they wish to connect with or follow. After the user has followed the creator, their content may now exist on the other side of TikTok. 
 Separated into two sections, the videos published by the users following will appear on the ‘following’ page, while other creators will appear on the “for you page”. The users following page exists to serve individuals with accessible access to their favourite content creators and avoid missing out on their friend’s and families’ posts.
 Another way to interact on TikTok is to engage in creators’ “lives”. Users may choose to go live to interact with their followers in real-time. By sharing insight into their daily living, creators find great success in expanding their followers and creating user engagement. Another unique feature allows for creators to go live with other fellow creators on the app. TikTok lives provide users with access to comment, ask questions and send or receive gifts. Although, TikTok requires users to meet a following of 1,000 and be 16 years of age in order to host a live. 


### Content {-}

#### Content Sharing {-}

On TikTok, users have the ability to share any post they see on their feed. In order to share a video, users must tap the arrow located in the bottom right hand corner. Once the user has clicked the share arrow, a variety of methods to share are displayed. These options include the ability to share the video through copying the link or sharing it on another social media platform such as Snapchat, Messages, Facebook messenger or Instagram.  

![share](assets/tiktok/share.jpg)

#### Privately Sharing Content {-}

When a user initially creates a TikTok account, the videos and comments are set to be public. This means any TikTok user can access the content and follow the account. However, TikTok does have Privacy settings that allow the account to be changed to private. When the account is set to private, the account holder can approve or deny follow requests and only their approved followers can view the content. 

Even if the account is set to public, the account holder has access to edit the privacy settings on individual videos. These privacy settings allow users to allow everyone access, only the followers that users follow back, or only the account holder to view the video.

![content](assets/tiktok/content.jpg) 

#### Viral Content {-} 

Content published on TikTok has the ability to go viral any time a user creates and uploads a public video onto their account. If the content a user creates gets picked up by the TikTok algorithm, it will be shared to other users via the “For You” page. Based on the user's interests and past interactions with TikTok videos, TikTok's algorithm curates a "For You" page of video content from creators the user may not follow. The algorithm utilizes users’ data on interactions with videos such as the screen time of watching a video, liking the video, and/or sharing it.

![foryou](assets/tiktok/foryou.jpg) 

Once the video makes it to the “For You” page, it has the opportunity to go viral. As a video receives more comments, likes, shares, and duets, the greater its chances are of being picked up by the algorithm. The completion rate of a users’ videos is an additional factor that influences ranking. In short, the more a video is liked and fully watched, the greater it’s chances are of going viral.

### Business Details {-}

#### Private Parent Company {-}

The founder, Chairman and former CEO Zhang Yiming created ByteDance in 2012 and developed the video sharing app TikTok aswell. ByteDance, Tiktok's parent company, is based in Beijing, storing the information of over a billion users worldwide. As the name implies a parent company serves to control the interests of another company. The parent company is privately owned by a Chinese tech company, with no opportunities for other interested parties to buy in. 

#### Major Investors {-}

Despite the main ownership of TikTok being owned by the Beijing-based tech company commonly referred to as “ByteDance”, in recent years pressure by the Trump Administration forced Bytedance to expand and create a new company referred to as TikTok Global.  These steps allowed Americans to feel safe about the storing and gathering of their citizen’s information, as opposed to China potentially using it to gain insight and track Americans. To date, the current minority owners are Oracle and Walmart. Oracle holds a 12.5% stake in the company, with Walmart in at 7.5%.

#### Revenue Generated {-} 

The business model of leading social media apps is quite similar to one another and leads to the generation of profits. While TikTok is free to download, the network does exceptionally well from paid advertisements and in-app-purchases. Scrolling through the “for-you” page, embedded in-feed ads will begin on auto-play. Tiktok will direct ads based on the user’s interactiveness with certain content. This is very helpful for business to grow, network and generate profits, however, the current cost of in-feed ads start at a minimum of $10 per Cost Per thousand/ mile views (CPM). Furthermore, there also exists brand-takeover ads, which begin to play an ad from the moment the app is launched. Businesses may prefer to buy into these ads, to grab the attention of their target audience while they are most attentive. To view ads, a more prestigious form of advertising consists of longer adds up to 60 seconds that pop up during the duration of a user’s activity on the app. Branded hashtag challenges also exist to create brand awareness. The hashtag appears on the discovery page as a fun way to boost user engagement and get messages across. Lastly, branded effects offered by TikTok allow businesses to purchase custom stickers or filters that can be used by users on TikTok for a period of 10 days. As for in-app purchases, TikTok has utilized virtual coins to be purchased and shared among its users. Ranging from 100 to 10,000 virtual coins, the price can vary between 99 cents- $99.99. The in-app currency allows users to show appreciation for the content they engage in and enjoy!

## Privacy and Surveillance {-}

### TikToks ToS and Privacy Policy {-} 

[Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service?lang=en)
[Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-row?lang=en)
[Privacy Policy for Younger Users](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-for-younger-users?lang=en)

### Key Takeaway's from TikToks Privacy Policy {-}

TikTok's Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policies (PP) are both legal contracts that bind the platform and its users. I was not surprised about the tenacity of the ToS and PP of TikTok. The ToS is impossibly long and I did not understand a single word of it. If you were to try and attempt to read and understand the ToS, I would applaud you and give you all of my life's savings because it would take me a week, maybe a month to read and re-read to understand just the ToS. The PP and PP for younger users were easier to understand and were significantly shorter than the ToS. I used a keyword search to search for specific words such as 'Privacy' and 'Access' for the general PP, and 'Collect' for the Younger Users PP. Because the keyword search searches all words regarding 'Privacy', 'Access', and 'Collect', I excluded the times it was mentioned in titles, headings, or weblinks to narrow down the search results. 

According to TikTok, they are not responsible for the privacy policy of third-party partnerships and advertisements that are provided in the app via Cookies ^[[TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 20](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-row?lang=en)]. They also note that if a user follows a link outside or from a Third-party source, TikTok is again not responsible or liable for their PP (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 37). I found one single point that seems to be not as invasive, but still not entirely ethical. It states that if there are any questions, how to use, or want to know if you have any rights in your country, to contact them via email again ^[[TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 34](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2Flegal%2Fprivacy-policy-row%3Flang%3Den&data=04%7C01%7C%7Ced2e0d7557fd40b8c7b508da0f6fe370%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637839270483285606%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=CHaGUlTBmeylRs%2BSOVO0QrRDQu2iKWFcMwINCed5NiA%3D&reserved=0)]. I would not consider this to be a positive point thinking more about it as I write, it seems like they added this in just to say that they mentioned you have rights without actually caring about your rights or you as a person.

Under the section 'User Content and Behavioural Information' TikTok could collect information such as identifying objects and scenery that appear in the background, location, face, and body attributes from the user's content ^[[TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 10](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2Flegal%2Fprivacy-policy-row%3Flang%3Den&data=04%7C01%7C%7Ced2e0d7557fd40b8c7b508da0f6fe370%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637839270483285606%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=CHaGUlTBmeylRs%2BSOVO0QrRDQu2iKWFcMwINCed5NiA%3D&reserved=0)]. They may also collect and review your interests, gender, and age for the purpose of personalizing content, as well as "promoting your content to other users and exploring whether your profile presents further opportunities for collaboration" ^[[TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 10](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2Flegal%2Fprivacy-policy-row%3Flang%3Den&data=04%7C01%7C%7Ced2e0d7557fd40b8c7b508da0f6fe370%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637839270483285606%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=CHaGUlTBmeylRs%2BSOVO0QrRDQu2iKWFcMwINCed5NiA%3D&reserved=0)]. Just reading these parts makes me want to delete the app and triggers all the red flags. I really do not feel entirely safe on TikTok, or any app after reading just one Privacy Policy.

When comparing the PP to the Younger Users Privacy Policy (YUPP), I was speechless and shocked at how different they were. YUPP is significantly shorter than the PP,  there were no drop-down pages, just one simple scroll-down page. I tried searching for 'Privacy' in the keyword search but there was almost nothing I could review so I used 'Collect' instead as it had a better outcome. According to TikTok, they collect limited information only for youth under 13 ^[[TikTok. January 2020. Para. 1-2](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-for-younger-users?lang=en)]. They only collect the username, password, birthday, and some info about the user's device such as network activity like device ID, IP address, web browser type etc. ^[[TikTok. January 2020. Para. 3](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-for-younger-users?lang=en )]. These points are so simple and they personally seem less invasive and more secure than what everyone else must to consent to. TikTok can and may use the username and password to authenticate the user, but I do not understand how or why they do that. They also only use the information for troubleshooting and other analytical services as well as for legal and governmental reasons which not only is rare, but is reasonable as it is law enforcement. ^[[TikTok. January 2020. Para. 4 & 6](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-for-younger-users?lang=en )].

The difference between these two Policies is shocking, and the only thing I can think is, why is it riskier for anyone over the age of 14 who is still minors to use TikTok? I personally am frightened at how loosely they speak about our rights in the PP and how much more protected users are in YUPP. I think all users of TikTok should be under the policies of the YUPP because it seems more serious about the security and integrity of the kids than it does with the bigger population which still include minors.


## Social Media and TikTok in Education {-}

### Interactions on TikTok {-}

Tiktok serves as a great resource for individuals to interact with other content creators, comedians or those in the arts community. The platform includes a plethora of features that allow its users to comment, like, share and send gifts to their favourite content creators. 

#### Leaving Comments {-}

A comment can easily be made on TikTok with a few simple steps! 
1. Select the video you plan to interact with
2. From here, you must tap the comment icon located on the right 
3. Tap the “add comment” box and write a message
4. Lastly, press send when you’re ready!

#### Liking {-}

Liking a video has never been easier for TikTok users. In order to like a video, one can simply tap the heart shaped icon located in the middle right side of the page. 

Picture

When a user likes the content produced by a content creator, the like is viewed by the person who made the video. However, it should be noted that unless you switch your privacy settings, everyone can view your video as well. Attached below are numerical steps to be followed if one wishes to switch their “like history” to not be viewed by others.

### Creators {-}

#### Educators on TikTik {-}

Educators use Tik Tik as a platform to reach audience members from all over the world. Tik Tok provides a platform for creators to share their voices and knowledge. Videos are created with the intent to educate viewers, answer questions and promote learning. All types of content are currently being taught on TikTok. Educators such as @Dad, how do I? Provides valuable life lessons and educates viewers on how to fix things. You can also access content such as @Janelle Rohner which educates viewers on Keto lifestyles and provides weight loss tips. Depending on the type of content the creators produce, this determines the type of audience members. For instance, @Dad, how do I? Has an audience of mostly young people while @Janelle Rohner’s audience is an older audience as some of the content she shares is keto drinks for those 19+. No matter the topic of interest, there is sure to be a content creator producing educational content on that particular topic.

#### Educators Responses to Comments and Questions {-}

A majority of creators prioritize replying and addressing questions made by their audience to create engagement and prove continstency. Responses can directly be responded to in a video, and is often done so by creators. When a question has been asked, educators may produce a video that shows the question being asked and them addressing it. This way, they can directly address the comments and/or questions of their viewers.  An example of this is shown below. 

Emily: The Video I have posted on mine, only got 76 views, 2 likes and 1 follower. Like Mia, I am certain the only reason why I got this many views is from my hashtags. Some of the Hashtags I used were, #freshfoods #healthyliving #newrecipe. I have learned some interesting tips from my sister about hashtags as she manages 5 social media pages for companies. Your post will get more engagement if the hashtag you use has fewer tags altogether. I tried finding ones with the lowest number of tags so more people could see the post but in conclusion, it did not work very well. I feel like to get more engagement on TikTok, the persona would have to be constantly active and posting in order for people to see and engage. Due to the algorithm, you must post often in order to be visible or else you will get pushed into the background and not be seen.

#### TikTok as a PLN {-}

Educators on Tik Tok are able to use the platform as a Personal Learning Network (PLN). For instance, Tik Tok provides educators with a space to share and utilize worksheets, assignments and activities that fellow teachers have created. The growth of TikTok has allowed it to beome a virtual team, to distribute and swap ideas. The app can be a great tool for teacher to expand their personal learning networks and gain insight on useful methods employed by teacher alike.

### Educational Post on TikTok Experience {-}

### Concerns with TikTok {-}

As with any social media platform, educators should be aware of the inappropriate content that can be accessed on the app. The most obvious sources of adult content on TikTok are profanity and suggestive clothing. Although the minimum age for a TikTok user is 13 years old, the app does not use any age verification tools when users are creating an account. With the ability to search any hashtag or keywords in the app, users can access any content created by another user. Although TikTok has strict guidelines on nudity and graphic content, since any user can upload their opinions on any topic, offensive content may be shared on the app. Due to the nature of the social media app, when a video becomes viral millions of people can be impacted by ampliganda. According to DiRestas, ampliganda is the new word for misinformation in the digital age. On TikTok, any user can now shape perceptions and realities by having their ideology amplified through shares, likes, and comments of a mass audience.

### Benefits of Being in the Pulic Eye on TikTok {-}

Being in the public eye is a massive responsibility. You can be seen as someone who is important to others, they might look up to you for advice or information ^[[Teets. 2015. First Slide](https://prezi.com/aqtzslm7fm-j/being-in-the-public-eye/)]. You can also be seen as an influential person, especially for kids or the younger generations ^[[Teets. 2015. First Slide](https://prezi.com/aqtzslm7fm-j/being-in-the-public-eye/ )]. Being in the public eye does open up a lot of business opportunities for you because if you own your own business, people can reach out to you online and also other businesses can ask to collaborate with them or they may even invest in your own business. One questionable trait of being public, is that what you put into social media, everybody is going to perceive you differently ^[[Teets. 2015. Third Slide](https://prezi.com/aqtzslm7fm-j/being-in-the-public-eye/ )]. You're a different person in your daily life than what you put out there on social media and other people can and will usually make up a new version of yourself in their mind just from what they read online. Concluding, in order to be in the public eye, be extra aware and also accountable for what you post and put out online.
Your personal learning network (PLN), is your own unique specific fingerprint you have online. Because your PLN is your own personal Network, it allows you to personalize it for yourself and your specific things you are wanting to get out of being in the public eye ^[[Trach. 2017. Para 6](https://www.schoology.com/blog/personal-learning-network-pln-benefits-tools-and-tactics#:~:text=A%20PLN%20allows%20you%20to,you're%20struggling%20to%20reach )]. Because today's society and world is all based online, there is always new information and ideas and the world is just changing so much faster according to Trach (2017). The benefits of having a PLN is that you can have "open collaboration" with people all around the world and there are no limits to it. It also provides opportunities to share your ideas, opinions, or your own research in your education ^[[Trach.2017. Characteristics of a Personal Learning Network](https://www.schoology.com/blog/personal-learning-network-pln-benefits-tools-and-tactics#:~:text=A%20PLN%20allows%20you%20to,you're%20struggling%20to%20reach)].  With a PLN you can also choose if you want to be public or not, as much as privacy and terms of service will allow, which is truly not so private (refer to my Privacy and Surveillance Section). My favorite aspect of having a PLN is that it's accessible, you can network with people ,and collaborate with others. You have the opportunity to make more connections and learn from anyone and anywhere in the world. Trach (2017) emphasizes that with a PLN there is a "give and take" where you should share what has been the most effective for you online, such as useful resources or websites that others can build upon in order to reciprocate the inclusivity and effort everyone else is providing to you ^[[Relationships: Para 9 & 10](https://www.schoology.com/blog/personal-learning-network-pln-benefits-tools-and-tactics#:~:text=A%20PLN%20allows%20you%20to,you're%20struggling%20to%20reach )].

### Employers Limiting Factors, Restrictions and Benefits {-}

### Reliability {-}

### Minimising Misinformation {-}

### Access and Inclusion {-}

TikTok does have a page all about accessibility and inclusivity. Some features of accessibility include,  warnings of photosensitivity and epilepsy triggers, Animated thumbnails to aid in people who are sensitive to flashing pictures, Text-to-Speech features, and auto-captioning (TikTok. 2022. Accessibility). Although these features will aid people with vision or epileptic symptoms and provide more information under the "Read More" button of each feature, it does not provide other accessibility needs for other people with specific requests like autism or down syndrome. TikTok (2022) states in the first line of the Accessibility page that they are "committed" to keep an inclusive environment to support the "diverse" community (para 1). From looking at the accessible features, it does not look entirely diverse as it only caters to two specific demographics.
Coming from personal experience to what I have seen from the two autistic creators I follow, Nicole Parrish (@soundoftheforest) and Paige Layle (@paigelayle). TikTok does not seem to treat them equally or as equal as everyone else. For example, Parrish was shadow banned. I have attempted to find the TikTok she had posted about this, but I could not find it. It may have been removed or made private by the creator herself. This means that TikTok will hide their profile from their followers because they are posting content that "violates the community guidelines'', which is not the case. Both of these pages post educational content about autism awareness and everyday education. Parrish has a hobby in insects, particularly moths, and she loves showing and educating about them. Layle's page is primarily about autism awareness and she also educates about being ableist and discrimination towards all neurodivergent communitites. She is a role model that educates and supports against stereotypes, ableism, and discrimination of all kinds. You can check out Parrish's and Layle's pages here: ^[[Nicole Parrish @Soundoftheforest]( https://www.tiktok.com/@soundoftheforest?lang=en)] and ^[[Paige Layle @paigelayle]( https://www.tiktok.com/@paigelayle?lang=en)]
It is possible to provide accessible needs in your own videos, but TikTok itself does not have or offer a diverse range of options as you make content. If a creator is wanting to post accessible content, it is their own responsibility to provide it within their own video, which I personally think is not right for TikTok to not provide a wider range of features for all people.
I highly recommend supporting diverse pages and giving them the opportunity to use their voice. During Black History month as well as Indingeous Month, I saw a lot of settler creators stitch or duet these Black, Indigenous Peoples of Color (BIPOC) and use their platform to boost these creators' pages. Something simple as a duet can show their voices and your allyship to whoever you follow or needs it. The best way to support is to not talk or add anything alongside the others post, it will take away their own voice and power because you are diverting the viewers to look at you talking instead of the creator you are supporting. Try posting just a blank duet, or simply you doing chores while listening to what the creator has to say. This Shows people that you support and listen to creators who are being excluded. Be an ally and support, but not by silencing them and speaking over or for them yourself.
